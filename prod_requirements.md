##**Self-correcting Math Exercises**
Kids are stupid. That's why they go to school, to be less so. One important part of the destupiding process is to teach them maths. The problem with maths is that it requires a lot of practice, repetitive practice and then some poor fucker has to correct it. [A rough example](https://www.seohmygod.me/sitemap-pages.xml) of a tool in order to solve some of these issues can be found at the aforementioned link. The idea is to generate a random list of math exercises where the answer to the previous exercise is the first addend in a subsequent exercise. This way the kids can figure out themselves if they calculated it correctly, and still get that sweet, sweet practice in without further teacher input and control. This doc will list the requirements of this tool, and serve as a guideline / roadmap for execution.
