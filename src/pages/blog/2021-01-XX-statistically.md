## So you're learning German

Half way through an article, or in the middle of a conversation, patiently waiting for the verb to arrive at the end of a sentence (The quick brown fox over the lonely dog jumps, z.b.), and **blam:**  
There's a word that you recognize, that doesn't immediately induce Duo-based PTSD. A word from a language you actually speak with confidence! There's three ways it can go down from here:
- this word is living proof of the shared history of English and German, ready to lend you a hand in this most difficult time, trying to explain your favourite food to your inlaws
- this word has the exact opposite meaning that it has in English, and will sabotage your confidence and credibility for years to come.
- this word has the exact same meaning, but is pronounced so differently for a while you wonder if you've forgotten how to speak entirely, until eventually it clicks ("Ahhh, Ma-te-ri-**al**!" )

Obviously, the road ahead to Fleißigkeit is fraught with danger, but you need to act quickly. What are the chances of each of the above cases? What are the odds?
Here's a non-exhaustive look at cognates, false friends & similar words, bundled into some vaguely scientific-looking graphs to reassure you that this is trustworthy to some degree.
