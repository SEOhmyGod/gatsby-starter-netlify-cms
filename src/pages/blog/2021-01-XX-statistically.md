## So you're learning German {#intro}

Half way through an article, or in the middle of a conversation, patiently waiting for the verb to arrive at the end of a sentence (The quick brown fox over the lonely dog jumps, z.b.), and **blam:**  
There's a word that you recognize, that doesn't immediately induce Duo-based PTSD. A word from a language you actually speak with confidence! There's at least three ways it can go down from here:
- this word is living proof of the shared history of English and German, ready to lend you a hand in this most difficult time, trying to explain your favourite food to your inlaws
- this word has the exact opposite meaning that it has in English, and will sabotage your confidence and credibility for years to come.
- this word has the exact same meaning, but is pronounced so differently for a while you wonder if you've forgotten how to speak entirely, until eventually it clicks ("Ahhh, Ma-te-ri-**al**!" )

Obviously, the road ahead to die Zungenfertigkeit is fraught with danger, but you need to act quickly. What are the chances of each of the above cases? What are the odds?
Here's a non-exhaustive look at cognates, false friends & similar words, bundled into some vaguely scientific-looking graphs to reassure you that this is trustworthy to some degree.
