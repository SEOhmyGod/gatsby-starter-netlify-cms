## So you're learning German

Half way through an article, or in the middle of a conversation, patiently waiting for the verb to arrive at the end of a sentence (The quick brown fox over the lonely dog jumps, z.b.), and **blam:**
There's a word that you recognize, that doesn't immediately induce Duo-based PTSD. A word from a language you actually speak with confidence! There's at least three ways it can go down from here:
- this word is living proof of the shared history of English and German, ready to lend you a hand in this most difficult time, trying to explain your favourite food to your inlaws
- this word has the exact opposite meaning that it has in English, and will sabotage your confidence and credibility for years to come.
- this word has the exact same meaning, but is pronounced so differently for a while you wonder if you've forgotten how to speak entirely, until eventually it clicks ("Ahhh, Ma-te-ri-**al**!" )

Obviously, the road ahead to die Zungenfertigkeit is fraught with danger, but you need to act quickly. What are the chances of each of the above cases? What are the odds?
Here's a non-exhaustive look at cognates, false friends & similar words, bundled into some vaguely scientific-looking graphs to reassure you that this is trustworthy to some degree.

## Select False Friends

| German | English | German meaning | English Meaning | Example of fallout |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|:-------------------:|
| gift | gift | poison | present | Walking into Douglas and asking for gift ideas ***will*** get you some odd looks |
| dick | dick | thick | penis, Little Richard | Dickmilch, 'nuff said' |
| impregnieren | impregnate | to waterproof, to coat | to waterproof, to coat, more often to make someone pregnant | Ignore at your own peril, Schuhficker |
| bekommen | become | to receive | to begin to be | Mostly humourous when Germans fall foul, "Can I please become a Guinness? "Better men than you have tried" |
| arm | arm | poor | the bit between your body and your hands | "Arm aber sexy" get's a whole new meaning |
| Box | box | Speaker | a container that does **not** play music | Music may lift you up, but it's not going to help you move flat |
| Brief | brief | a letter | short, temporary | Dear Sir / Madam, just don't. |
| breit | bright | wide | light, smart | Accidental fat jokes a plenty |
| Fahrt | fart | a drive, trip, ride | to break wind | My dad's favourite, difficult to keep a straight face on any road trip |
| Handy | handy | Mobile phone | useful, at hand | When your Handy isn't handy, but it's still a Handy :/ |
| Hose | hose | Trousers | transporter of liquids | Just plain confusing. Also singular in German |
| Rezept | receipt | Prescription | Proof of purchase | Honorary entry where the word is longer in English than in German |



## Select Cognates (True Friends who help you hide ze Körper)


| German | English | Meaning | Example of awesomeness |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| Alphabet | alphabet | the very building blocks of words | helpful to be able to fall back on |
| April, August | April, August | Basically all the months of the year | At least you'll always be able to read a calendar |
| Apfel | apple | fruit, overly successful tech company | Keep the doctor at bay and your account empty in either language |
| Bank | bank | place that keeps more of your money than you do | Financial matters are safe |
| bitter | bitter | sharp taste, disappointing | It'll help you adequately describe your failings and how you feel about them |
| blind | blind | unable to see | Handy to describe yourself after missing something particularly obvious, albeit rather ableist |
| bringen | bring | to take with to a place | it'll always be with you, wherever you go |
| Butter | butter | fatty spread that makes everything taste better | Combined with Toast, you're sorted for breakfast |
| Drama | drama | theatre, excessive emotion for the situation | This'll keep you going till curtain call |
| Finger | finger | digit on the hand | You can't deny I've got a point here |
| Gas | gas | a state of matter of extremely low density and high volume | Not used as frequently in other contexts compared to US/UK |
| plus | plus | indicator of positivity, mathematical sign for addition | a value-add to your quill |
| trink |  drink | to imbibe a liquid, probably alcohol | Imbibe enough, and it won't even matter if this word is your friend or not |


## Edge cases / Weirdness
There are a few cases that you can rely on in principle, but even if the word does indeed retain it's meaning across the language divide, it's pronunciation will likely not have survived the crossing. Anything that stems from Latin will be great, as soon as you learn how to say it properly. Examples such as "Anasthesia", "Anasthesiologist", "Anasthetic", or any medical term will take some getting used to in order to use effectively, but once you've got it, you can be sure you'll have issues saying it in English forever more.


## Summation & Conclusion
So how does German fare? Will it get Kohle or Kohle for Christmas?

 In the end, it's the same as any other language compared to your own. Some similarities are helpful, others aren't. What matters is practice, and being able to enjoy (and learn from) the mistakes you'll make along the way. [Cue Hallmark schmalzy music]
if you're feeling disappointed by this on-the-fence result, it Zauns about right to me :)
