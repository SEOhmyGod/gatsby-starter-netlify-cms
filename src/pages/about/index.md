### Hi Tom, I'm me
This is probably going to be a mess for a long time, as I'm teaching myself web dev on the side. I'm a Product Manager with a focus on SEO, and it's high time I actually practically apply the knowledge I spend my days encouraging others to use. Additionally, there'll be some...interesting tools popping up and other random elements as I figure out how to develop my strand of the web...
